# Mapping_Earthquakes
GeoJSON

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

## Tasks
To complete this project, use of a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website along with retrieval of geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days was needed. This data was then added to a interactive map.

## Results
Using JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data along with the Leaflet library a plot of the data was overlayed on a Mapbox map through an API request.  The final product created is interactive with the earthquake data.
